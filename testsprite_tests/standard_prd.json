  "product_overview": "StemSplit is an AI-powered web application for client-side audio separation, splitting music tracks into four distinct stems: vocals, drums, bass, and other. It enables users to upload audio files, process them via simulated AI stem extraction, and interact with separated stems through playback and download features.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable easy drag-and-drop audio file upload with validation for MP3 and WAV formats under 10MB.",
    "Provide real-time feedback on audio processing status with progress indicators and ability to cancel.",
    "Display separated audio stems with individual playback controls and download options.",
    "Ensure all audio processing occurs client-side to protect user privacy.",
    "Offer a smooth, mobile-responsive user experience across homepage, processing, and results pages."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "FileUpload component supporting drag-and-drop and click-to-upload for MP3 and WAV files with size limit and preview of file name, size, and duration.",
    "Animated ProgressBar showing processing percentage, current stem being extracted, estimated time remaining, and cancel functionality.",
    "StemPlayer components color-coded per stem (vocals in sky blue, drums in emerald green, bass in amber, other in pink) with play/pause, volume control, mute toggle, seek bar, and download button.",
    "StemGrid layout showing all four StemPlayers with an additional download-all stems button.",
    "Homepage with hero section, feature highlights, file upload area, and call-to-action to start processing.",
    "Processing page displaying extraction progress details and automatic redirection to results page upon completion.",
    "Results page presenting separated stems with playback controls, download options, usage tips, and ability to process another file.",
    "Responsive header and footer components with navigation and links including GitHub repository."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on Homepage, reads product description, uploads valid audio file via drag-and-drop or file selector, reviews file preview, and clicks 'Separate Audio' to begin processing.",
    "App navigates to Processing Page showing animated progress bar with current stem extraction status and estimated time remaining; user may cancel to return to Homepage.",
    "Upon processing completion, user is redirected to Results Page with four separated stem players, each with controls for play, volume, mute, seek, and download.",
    "User may download stems individually or all at once, and choose to process another audio file, returning to the Homepage."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Homepage loads with hero section visible; file upload area accepts only valid MP3 and WAV files under 10MB.",
    "Invalid file types or oversized files trigger appropriate error messages.",
    "Progress bar animates with correct percentage and updates current stem extraction messages during processing.",
    "Cancel button on Processing Page aborts process and navigates to Homepage.",
    "Results Page displays all four StemPlayers with functional playback controls and download buttons.",
    "'Download All Stems' button downloads all stems in a batch.",
    "'Process Another File' button resets application state and navigates to Homepage.",
    "All audio processing simulation occurs client-side without data leaving the browser.",
    "UI is fully responsive and accessible on both mobile and desktop devices."
